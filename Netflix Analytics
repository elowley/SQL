In these SQL codes below, I am querying data from a Netflix database to answer a few questions.

-How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

-When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT max (date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

-List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

-Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT director 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" a
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" b
ON a.show_id = b.show_id
WHERE title = 'Bright Star';

-What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
select title, release_year
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
where type = 'Movie'
Order by release_year asc
LIMIT 2;
